# Using the Waste Stream

Urban and suburban areas are full of garbage, which can be found in dumpsters, curbside piles, wastebaskets, and elsewhere.  The extent of the garbage production poses a threat to the natural environment as well as to human health, but it also offers opportunities to procure the raw materials for building new useful things. Below is a list of links to illustrate the various ways waste can be used, broken down into categories by type of waste. 

## Food and Kitchen Waste

## Electronic Waste

*  [E-Waste to Makerspace](https://e-wastetomakerspace.wikispaces.com/E-Waste+to+Makerspace) - Include plans for a 3D printer and a plant watering system.
